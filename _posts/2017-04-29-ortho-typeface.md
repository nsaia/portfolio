# Ortho Typeface

This is a typeface I designed for a typography class in college. The goal was to create my own
display typeface utilizing a grid and then create a specimen sheet for it. The name "Ortho" comes
from the term "orthogonal projection". It is a way of viewing three-dimensional space without
any form of perspective distorting the angles. Every character in the piece is created entirely
with equilateral triangles.
