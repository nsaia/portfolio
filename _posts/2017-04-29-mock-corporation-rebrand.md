This was a series of designs I made for a school assignment in college. I was tasked with
choosing an existing brand and revamping their brand identity. I chose GitHub as my subject, as
I am a huge fan of the company and their platform. The first image shown is the logo I came up with,
the second is a set of stationery designs, and the third is my branding applied to different
merchandise.
