# Levi Stamps - Design Through History

This series of images was a school project I did during college. The assignment spanned seven weeks,
and we were tasked with researching each major era of design throughout history. We were to pick a
brand and create a "stamp" representing that brand within each design era. I picked Levi because
they are a brand that has been around nearly as long as the scope of this assignment.
