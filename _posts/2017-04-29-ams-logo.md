# SHSU AMS Branch Logo

This is a logo I created for the American Mathematical Society (AMS) branch of SHSU (Sam Houston
State University). It was used for t-shirts and promotional material distributed around the school.
While the AMS and SHSU both have their own branding, I was asked to create something unique. The
design the client chose was the first one shown, inspired by Google's material design. Other
variants that were not selected are shown above as well.
