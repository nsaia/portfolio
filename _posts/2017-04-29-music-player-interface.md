# Music Player Interface

This was a concept design I did for a personal project that I had planned, under the name Chickadee.
The goal was to create a music player, similar to iTunes or Spotify. In the end, the project didn't
take off, but I did get a chance to design an interface that I was happy with. The interface, as
shown above, was intended to be clean and simple, using flat colors and hard edges throughout.
