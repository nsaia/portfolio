# PCB Designer UI Icons

This is a set of UI icons I created for a client who was developing a website to create schematics
and build printed circuit boards (PCBs). Due to the fact that the client wanted to open his
platform on the web and in the form of an Android application, he requested that it retain the
look and feel of other similar applications. I followed Google's material design guidelines so
they would look great at any size.
