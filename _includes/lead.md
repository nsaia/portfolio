Welcome
=======

My name is Nick, and I'm a graphic designer and web developer. I am
proficient in both digital and printed work. This website serves as a
portfolio for some of the work I've done in the past, including projects
that were created entirely on my own as well as projects that I worked on
with a team of other designers and developers. A biography about myself can
be found on the **About** page, and my contact information for business
inquiries is listed on the **Contact** page.

I hope you like what you see!
