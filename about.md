# About Me

My name is Nick, and I'm a graphic designer and web developer. I am proficient
in both digital and printed work. I've spent the majority of my life learning
new programming languages, technologies, and strategies for solving problems.
This website serves as a portfolio for my work, both projects I have done on my
own or with a team of other designers and developers.

I started my college career at the University of New Hampshire, as a computer
science major. I spent about two years there before realizing the type of
material we were being taught did not align with my philosophies. I strive to use
code as an art form, finding new and creative ways to solve problems efficiently.
Because of this, I made a major career change and decided to go into
digital design.

As of now, I am 24 years old, and living in Dover, New Hampshire. I'm very
interested in living in different places throughout the country and potentially
the world â€“ my next target is Seattle, Washington. My hobbies outside design and
programming include trading card games, collecting fountain pens, and enjoying Japanese
media.
